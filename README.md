# TypeScript React and ASP .NET Full-stack Application -House Bids Project-

## Description
This repository is dedicated to creating a full-stack web application using React and ASP .NET Core 8. The main goal of this project is to achieve the following objectives:
- Learn how to create a minimal API with ASP .NET Core 8.
- Consume the endpoints created in the TypeScript project.
- Utilize the React UseQuery npm package to facilitate API calls.
- Develop Swagger documentation for the API, covering all potential status codes.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation provided in this repository to gain insights into building a TypeScript React and ASP .NET full-stack application. 

## Installation 
To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Navigate to ReactWeb directory where all the static files in
4. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
6. Now navigate to the minimalApi directory.
7. Run the api with command "dotnet run".

## Usage
Once the project is set up and running, you can interact with the application as follows:
- Access the Swagger documentation at `http://localhost:4000/swagger/index.html`. -you can change it from the "lunch.json" file-
- Use the React components to consume the API endpoints efficiently.
- Leverage the capabilities of React UseQuery npm package for making API calls seamlessly.
